# MeditationApp

A simple relaxation application used to help facilitate meditation with peaceful sounds of nature set on a timer. 

## Description

This program was created using Javascript, HTML and CSS to enable users to choose a preferred ambient sound to relax to. The background video and sound effects change depending on which choice is clicked. 
The user can also choose a time of 5, 10 or 30 minutes. A moving outline shows the timer's progress, as well as a timer counting down.
